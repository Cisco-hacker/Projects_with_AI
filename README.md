## About This Repository

This repository is my personal playground for developing practical tools inspired by everyday needsâ€”solutions I build whenever I find no existing app fits the bill. Each project here is crafted entirely through collaboration with AI, leveraging GPT models and various AI platforms to bring my ideas to life.

From the initial concept to refining and enhancing the code, AI guides the entire development process based on the prompts and feedback I provide. The result is a collection of smart, functional applications tailored to solve real problems, created through the synergy of human creativity and artificial intelligence.

## Current Projects

- **Batch Renamer**  
  A versatile tool designed to rename multiple files with customized patterns. Features include interactive selective replacements, regex and non-regex modes, extension filtering, preview with color-coded highlights, and exportable as standalone executables.

*(More projects coming soon!)*

## How I Work With AI

- I begin with an idea or a problem I want to solve.
- Using AI-powered platforms (like GPT), I brainstorm and generate code snippets.
- I iteratively refine and improve the code with AI assistance, based on testing and feedback.
- The final product is tested and packaged, sometimes into executable files for easy use.
