# Batch Renamer (PyQt5)

A powerful and user-friendly batch file renaming tool built with Python and PyQt5.

---

## About the Project

This tool helps you rename multiple files at once using flexible patterns, with features to:

- Remove or replace specific substrings or regex patterns in filenames  
- Selectively replace first, last, all, or specific occurrences  
- Add prefixes or suffixes to filenames  
- Filter files by extension  
- Preview changes with color-coded highlights before renaming  
- Interactive prompts for handling multiple occurrences  
- Error handling and clear rename operations

---

## Why I Built This

Initially, I wanted a simple way to remove patterns like `-123` from filenames or add suffixes like `_edited`. But I ran into challenges:

- Patterns appearing multiple times per filename  
- Users unfamiliar with regular expressions  
- The need for an interactive way to choose which occurrences to replace

After experimenting, I implemented an **interactive mode** that lets users selectively replace occurrences with an easy-to-understand GUI.

## Features

- **Selective Replacement:** Choose which occurrence(s) of a pattern to replace  
- **Regular Expressions:** Enable or disable regex matching  
- **Extension Filtering:** Rename only files with specified extensions (e.g., `.txt`)  
- **Interactive Mode:** Prompts for user input when multiple matches are found  
- **Preview with Highlights:**  
  - ðŸ”´ Red = replaced text  
  - ðŸŸ  Orange = matched but unchanged  
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = added text (prefix/suffix)  
- **Error Handling:** Informs users if a rename fails  
- **PyQt5 GUI:** Smooth interface with improved color support compared to Tkinter

---

## How It Works

1. Select the folder containing files to rename  
2. Enter the pattern to remove or replace  
3. Optionally specify replacement text and occurrence (first, last, all)  
4. Add a prefix or suffix if desired  
5. Filter files by extension if needed  
6. Preview changes with color highlights  
7. Use interactive prompts to select specific occurrences when multiple matches occur  
8. Confirm and perform rename operation

## Packaging & Usage

Run the app directly with Python:

```bash
python src/batch_renamer.py
````

Or use the pre-built executables (Windows):

* **Single executable:**
  `batch_renamer_single.exe` â€” simple double-click runnable without dependencies

* **Folder package:**
  `batch_renamer_folder/` â€” contains all dependencies and files

---

## Building Executables Yourself

Use PyInstaller commands:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --name batch_renamer_single batch_renamer.py
pyinstaller --onedir --name batch_renamer_folder batch_renamer.py
```

---

## Future Plans

* Support for PySide6 GUI framework
* Advanced rename templates and presets
* Undo functionality for batch renames
* Multi-folder batch renaming

---

## Code Overview

The core rename logic is in the `rename_files` function, supporting:

* Pattern removal and replacement (regex or plain text)
* Selective occurrence handling
* Interactive user input for multiple matches
* Addition of prefixes/suffixes
* Extension filtering
* Dry-run preview and actual renaming with error handling

The PyQt5 GUI handles user interaction, previews, and triggers renaming.
